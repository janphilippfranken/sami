        "0": "POST: This is my first post so please be kind :)\n\nI know that lots of people often feel confused when they come out of a long-term relationship. They think they have forgotten how to be single, or how to flirt/date.\n\nI am one of these people.\n\nThe problem is, my relationship started when I had just turned 16. I have never been single - as an adult. That might sound silly. But the only time I have ever flirted or dated was as an over-confident, hormone-riddled teenager.\n\nNow I have a pretty demanding job, responsibilities blah blah... And I just don't know how to this!\n\nI'm no way in a rush to get into a new relationship, but that doesn't mean I want to be completely alone in the mean time.\n\nIf anyone has experienced anything similar, or just generally has some advice, it would be greatly appreciated!",
        "1": "POST: (Full background under my submitted)\n\nI decided I couldn't wait for my ex to come around since there was no guarantee that me waiting for her would be worth it. Sure since the breakup we hadn't talked as much obviously but now that we are done seemingly forever I can't comprehend at all knowing that we will never laugh, kiss, talk etc etc together ever again. \n\nWe had so many plans and so much love but now all that is gone. How do I coupe with that? How can I move on and be happy after knowing all the hard work we put in and all the love is out the door now. I just can't wrap my head around knowing that the girl I thought I would marry will now move on and live her life away from me till the day we both die.  \n\nI still do care for her, yes I still love her even after everything that happened at the end. I feel so alone and lost even though the actual break up was months ago, I'm honestly just afraid of the future now.",
        "2": "POST: Me and my girlfriend have been together for about 7 months now, and it has been a blast since the very first day. We basically went from rather good friends to an amazing couple without any awkwardness or friendzone-y (?) problems. Because of this, we are both pretty much convinced that we have found \"the one\".\n\nHowever, I recently learned that she is rather envious of my past girlfriends, my last ex in particular. As far as I can tell, her main concern is that I have been intimate in the same ways with them as I have been with her. She can't quite seem to grasp the idea that with her, everything is very much different. Sexual acts are much more meaningful, if that makes any sense, than they were before. \n\nAdditionally, she has a hard time processing the idea that I, at some point, loved and cared for them too in the same way as I care for her now. I tend to be a little \"overly-attached\" at times, so I can't really object to this statement. It is not entirely impossible that I care for her the way I do simply because it's in my nature.\n\nHowever, I am positive that I have never been in love with anyone as I have been with my current girlfriend, and wouldn't want it all to end because of this. I have consoled her the best I could, but I'd rather keep it from you redditors. This way, it might be easier to come up with an objective advice.",

While this is a great accomplishment I have noticed a significant spike in my sex drive during the week leading up to the race and in the days since I ran; about 10 days in total.\nI workout 2-3 times per week for about 45 minutes each time and have average eating habits. During the week leading up to the race, I ate mostly a plant-based diet - salad for lunch and dinner, fish for protein, etc. - and worked out 3 times and ran only twice (Not great prep, I know.) This helped me lose about 2 or 3 pounds.\nNow, I cannot stop thinking about sex! This morning (Thursday) I spent about 3 hours watching porn and \"distracted\" myself by going to a midday fitness class. Now I want to jerk off again or have find someone to sex.\nI don't know what to do. This is both embarrassing and confusing. I want to continue working out but am honestly afraid being fit will turn me into a sex addict.\nBackground: I played soccer in college and recall a similar correlation during my off season workouts. I am now in my late 20s and no longer train 5-6 days a week as was the norm in college. This is the most physically active I have been since my early 20s.\nQuestion: Is there research that has connected a higher sex drive (thinking more about sex) with a increased physical activity (working out)? Also, share your experiences because I feel like an outlier here.",

They're all fairly cute but I've been burned once by internet relationships and I wasn't really looking for another\n\nWell... I got drunk and told one of the girls that I thought she was really cute but that I \"didn't mean anything serious about it.\"\n\nI woke up in the morning and realized what I'd done and apologized and her exact words were \"no no, it's always nice to know somebody thinks you look nice :)\"\n\nI feel awful about it and I feel like a creep but I feel like apologizing further would just make it weirder. We haven't spoken since and I don't have many friends (even very casual ones like this one) and it just makes me feel worse that I think I accidentally fucked one up I think.\n\nI can include the exact messages exchanged if need be.",

Because of this, and several other things, I became quite depressed and our relationship suffered for it, and it eventually led to us breaking up. One of the main reasons him giving is that i was too negative and he couldn't deal with my depression as well as his stress, which I can understand.  \n\nAlthough i can see that the relationship wasn't right for me, I just cant get past that initial stage of heartbreak.  I have just been a complete mess for the past few weeks, cant sleep, cant eat, I cant do anything.  Having read all the articles about how to get over a relationship, I'm trying to follow them, but things are made difficult by the fact that a lot of my friends have moved away from my home town, there isn't much to do in the way of hobbies around here (I live in a small Welsh village), and most of the friends that I made in the past three years are mutual with my ex so it is difficult to visit and attend social events without seeing him.  I just feel really lonely.  I just dont know how to get out of this slump that I'm in.  I know people say that you have to go through the pain, but I feel unless I do something, I will never get through it.  \n\nHow have you gotten over the initial stages of heartbreak reddit?

        "6": "POST: It's summer and I've got a lot of time on my hands, I've also got some fat accumulating on my body that I really wouldn't like to be there and have a new appearance when I return to school in August. I'm a gamer so my diet is poor and I tend to sit around a lot. I've already got my diet on the way to a greener future so that is covered but thoughts are still welcome on that. I'd like to stay away from going to the gym if possible, my ultimate goal is to be thinner and look like I'm in good shape but I don't want to build a lot of muscle, so mostly cardio work I was thinking. I thought a morning jog that would go progressively further everyday would be a start but I'm unsure as I've never tried to lose weight before, doing this in the morning to me would also rid me of my laziness by forcing me to be active first thing in the morning. So anybody else that has advice or tips it'd be appreciated.",
        "7": "POST: We began dating right after 1st year Uni, dated 1 year then broke up for 6 months over differences in expectations for how long our dating would continue before marriage.\nI lean toward a shorter dating preference (1.5-3yrs) by which point I feel I would have decided on way or the other. She feels more that every other aspect of her life (career, school, family, financials...) must be perfectly in place to accommodate marriage regardless of how long that takes. \n\nAfter getting back together and being more clear that I would be willing to date happily until she felt her life was in order if she was considerate of me not wanting to date just to hold off marriage. and things have been going relatively well since then (3+ years since). We have travelled together, spent family holidays together and always been in open communication about our motivations, opinions, aspirations and disagreements. We have not lived together.\n\nSince 1-2 months ago we have been slowly having more and more difficulty with our depth/frequency of conversation and it is making her very uncertain about our relationships future and how much I care for her.\nI am someone who is very easygoing, patient, I feel loved by just spending quality time (out of the house especially) together a few times per week and doing random acts of kindness. I would only expect to have a thought provoking and deep conversation with my closest friends and family perhaps 1 time per month, and somewhat more with my SO.\nShe is someone who is very critical thinking, loves hugs and being complimented, and is always excited to just sit and talk about anything that comes to mind for a long time as long as the conversation is stimulating.\n\nIt does not, to me, feel like we've been having fewer conversations but she tells me I have been less ready to participate actively and less giving of my time for such conversations. I feel that such an intense level of conversation just isn't sustainable, she feels it's necessary. We plan to attend couples counselling this month for the first time.\n\nIs this normal? Is it a real problem or is one of us being unreasonable? Can anyone relate? I really do love her and want this to work.",
        "8": "POST: Obligatory this was when I was in high school. \n\nSo, for those of you who don't know, in Boston there's a shopping area called Haymarket. To all the tourists in the area, it's just Faneuil Hall, which is the crazy cramped food court building in the center of the area. You can get all kinds of foods there, ranging from Irish pub to mediocre Chinese food to sushi to Gelato. My personal favorite is currently the mac and cheese shop, but that's not the point.\n\nWhen I was in high school and come into Boston on my own, I would always make a bee line to the Greek shop in Faneuil Hall. During my first time there, I noticed the food item called \"tzatziki - a kind of Greek yogurt.\" Coming from East Bumfuck, NH, I didn't know much about many other cultures' food stuffs, but I certainly knew about Greek yogurt!\n\nI don't know why I choose this, because I hated yogurt at the time (\"it has live bacteria in it!\" I can't explain the logic in that argument if I tried,) but I decided to order it. The people at the counter looked at me and were like, \"Okay, tzatziki aaaaaand?\" And then I cheerfully replied with, \"Oh, and a Nantucket Nectar!\"\n\nThey just looked at me, reached into the display case, and slid the solid near-2 cup tub of tzatziki over to me. I bounced up and down in excitement, gave them some money (and told them to keep the change! I'm a good person!) And bounced upstairs to eat lunch with a spoon. It tasted great, but after like five or more bites it caused that reaction where your body is just like, \"Okay, you need to cool it with that stuff.\"\n\nI proceeded to order tzatziki every time I went to Faneuil Hall for a solid year. I couldn't figure out why everyone around me looked at me with mild disgust/bewilderment. Until I looked at the ingredient list for an online recipe for tzatziki.",
        "9": "POST: Okay... Long story short.\n\nMy wife was a school teacher but hated her life. At this time i was working full time and working on my degree. Well things flip flopped around and I ended up going to part time at work because I needed 50 credit hours to graduate and it was either get it done in one year or, because of prereqs, get it done in 2 1/2. After I moved to part time we got pregnant (planned) and my wife decided that she couldn't do the teaching thing anymore so she switched jobs. We were not thinking of the insurance implications. \n\nWe went from $90 a month to $750 for the three of us... thats right $750. We tried to split it up because coverage for her and the baby is $320 and my employer will offer me insurance for $380. We still couldnt budget that. So i go to the healthcare.gov website and apply but because my employer offers coverage i get no discount. I am now officially paying $175 for the worlds worst insurance only to avoid paying premium increase on our house and car insurance as well as the stupid tax for not having any. At this point I am wondering if it is even worth it to have a job because even though I would lose my part time income of 29k we could save 12k per year in day care costs and who knows, maybe get free health care (this of course really isn't an option)\n\nI would like to know if there is some sort of advocacy service that can help me navigate the insurance system so that I can get my family affordable insurance without paying over 15% of our annual  income.\n\nSorry if this comes across ranty but i just get discouraged when two people who try to plan, go to school, contribute to society, and stay employed end up getting shafted this hard when they simply want to get a pair of glasses and some back adjustments.",
        "10": "POST: So I did some looking around at different models of wrist mount GPS units. Cost and functionality were the biggest concern. I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).\n\nBest price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products.\n\nWent in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nSo I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any \"Garmin Fitness GPS\" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.\n\nHere's a link to the coupon. Hopefully it will be useful for someone out there within the next couple weeks. It expires on 2/28/2011.",
        "11": "POST: Just wanted to say sorry again for wasting your time helping me out! I know I'm probably blind or something. >.<\n\nI read the FAQ, and I was able to do some of the things to get started but many of the things I am still confused on. I was able to calculate my BMR (By the way is there one calculator that is better than the others? I got a few different numbers.) However, when I went to the link on the FAQ to calculate my BF%, the page was gone. Is this necessary? However, I know even without my BF% that I would be classified as \"skinny fat\" at 5'9 and 156 pounds with a decent layer of fat.\n\nThe next part I am confused on is diet. Most of the provided resources provide diets to try don't seem like they would lend themselves well to everyday/lifetime eating. I don't know how to eat healthy. The last time I tried to truly get in good shape I did it all wrong. I'm talking eating only 800-900 calories a day, counting obsessively, cutting out all my favorite foods, and interspersed with bouts of binging on aforementioned foods. Today, counting calories freaks me out because I fear that I will go back to that. \n\nI am trying to get into real fitness, like going to a gym or bodyweight fitness, but I cannot afford a gym membership and I can't seem to find something study enough to use as a pullup bar for bodyweight. What are my other options because I do want to build muscle.\n\nMy final question is that I have no idea what I am truly aiming for. I want to lose my layer of fat and build muscle, but I am not sure if there's a goal weight involved or what sort of time table I am looking at or how many calories I would need to eat. This brings us full circle as I restate that I have no idea what I am doing.",

His ex saw us all out at the pub one night and followed us home. My flatmate and I started getting abusive texts from her telling us to stay away from him or she would hurt us. She stalked us to the point where he had to take a restraining order against her and her sons. Drama followed this guy like a bad smell and he loved all the attention it brought him. He's a pathological liar and has lied about everything from being left at the alter, having cancer and to owning a gay cruising club. Unfortunately we can't kick him out of the flat as he is now on the lease and we can't afford to make rent payments with just the two of us.",

Our previous dates were always a bit awkward because we were both nervous and I've always found it hard to talk to the opposite sex (so lots of silence).\n\nSo I began talking to her again last week and I decided not to beat around the bush and asked if she wanted to catch up for coffee to which she agreed. So the beginning of the date kind of started awkward i found her eyes kept moving around the room and wouldn't keep eye contact for long, there were moments of short awkward pauses like before, she asked me questions about my family and about other things but I felt I was asking her more questions. The second half i felt we became more comfortable she kept moving her hair behind her ear, would smile more and kept eye contact more and we ended up talking straight for just over an hour. But after the date was over I feel disconnected or not reaching the level of intimacy that I feel i should've.\n\nI'm not sure if because of my low self esteem/ confidence of a bad breakup I'm overthinking or over expecting things or seeing shyness as being bored or uninterested, Or if shes sending me hints she wants to just be friends.\n\nAlso is it appropriate to send the night of the date a \"I had a great time, we should catch up again soon\" message?",

In our college's honor program enjoying life and utilizing my brain to the highest capacity. I've met some really cool people over the couple years at my college.

I don't know how we got to know each other, but anyway I really like talking to her. However, she told me that she's not too interested in doing anything out. Like going out. She's pretty comfy where she's at now and doesn't want to date. She told me that she liked me, but doesn't want to do that type of thing. It's pretty understandable.\n\nShe has a sister and I can sense that she really likes me! 0.o.

It was a really good meal and we have similar interests. She's a vegetarian and was on a cleanse and ate some really good looking salad! That alone was very admirable!

Now, I work night shift and my patrol area is a large group of bars where I basically deal with drunks constantly throughout the night.\n\nMy boyfriend is a bartender in that bar area. Lately he's been going out and drinking (mostly beer I believe) until about 1am give or take in this bar district. He does this while I'm at work over night. He does this about 3-4 times a week. \n\nSometimes it hurts my feelings because I work so hard in that area to do my job... Getting cussed, thrown up on, working car accidents, DWIs ect. It hurts me to think about my boyfriend hanging out and drinking at these bars while I'm working my butt off overnight.  If it was occasionally, I wouldn't mind. But it's several nights a week. \n\nI know my job is dangerous and I picked my career so I should deal with it. I don't feel like I deserve any special treatment but it also hurts when he decides to stay out and drink instead of coming by the house to say goodbye or anything at all before I go to work. I'm not saying be there every single day but... Maybe shoot me a text or something atleast.  \n\nI feel bad for letting it bother me, and I don't want to feel this way. I also don't know who he's with or when he'll eventually go home so that adds to it.. He knows my feelings on the situation but I feel that he does what he wants sometimes and will just brush it off or just apologize for it later.\n\nI don't want to nag him, he's a grown ass man... But at the same time, I'm not sure if I could have a potential future with him considering my career. \n\nIs this normal for guys to do and am I just over reacting?",

So i'll just start off by saying there is a girl, a girl i've been a schoolmate with for 8 years and have known her for about 13 years.\n\nFor as long as i can remember, i had a crush on her. Thought it was just going to pass, but i liked her more and more, so i worked up the nerve to ask her for her number a while ago. We never really hang out or anything, but we always greeted each other and talked for a bit if we saw each other anywhere.\n\nI got the number, even though it seemed like she wasn't too interested when she gave me it. She made an excuse when i called her to meet up, so i just figured she's not interested, but i can't just forget her, i'm in deep, even hearing her voice when i called her is like a drug to me. \n\nShe studies in a city about an hour away at the moment, which i will be going to with my friend. It's not because of her, we're going just to go out and party there, it's the capital here.\n\nWhich brings me up to my question.\nDo you guys/girls think there is still a chance? Should i call her one last time when i'll be there and ask if there is a chance if she makes an excuse again or what? If not,\n\nHow do I get over a lifelong crush?",

However, today, I knew I was going to quit, I was just going to wait until the end of my shift.\n\nThat's when the other food runner started acting like a millennial. First, she almost argued with me over the length of deployment in the military. I thought it was always 4 years, apparently to her, it's ALWAYS been 3. \n\nThen, while I'm sitting at the window waiting for food to come out, I hear her yell from the other side, \"If you're not doing anything, clean\"\n\nNow, I've worked in restaurants my whole life, I get the cleaning aspect and I usually am one to clean but I had just wiped down the counter and was talking to a server while waiting for the ticket to come up.\n\nWho does this bitch think she is? \n\nSo finally, I am refilling the ice and a manager comes up to me and goes, \"is everything okay? The food runner said that you are just talking and not working at all, are you good?\"\n\nOh no she didn't.\n\nThat's where I snapped. Calmly though. I was on the schedule to close and she was getting out in about 15 minutes. I went to the office to collect my tips and paychecks for the weeks past. The manager questioned slightly why I was leaving at 1015, I just said I was leaving at 1030 and was going to clock out right after . Our managers do not check schedules at all.  \n\nI collected my tips and checks and walked out. Knowing I left early enough for them to notice and make her stay until close.",

There are a couple issues: first, the physical distance between us and, second, her disproportionate feelings toward me. \n\nHer parents live about 20 minutes away from me so the distance wasn't a big deal for our first couple of dates. However, she is an undergraduate in a college that is 2.5 hours away from the city that I live/grad school that I attend. I've gone up and spent the weekend at her place, and she recently came down and split time with her family and me. \n\nThat's when we had a conversation, and we agreed to be exclusive. We agreed to take turns seeing each other every 2 weeks or so. We text and skype quite often to compensate for the lack of personal interaction. \n\nIt's obvious to me that she has intense feelings toward me, but I just don't feel such mad \"love.\" Example: I barely use facebook except for the chat function, but she just litters my wall with stuff. At the end of our recent meetup where she came to see me, she actually cried when it was time to say goodbye for 2 weeks. \n\nDon't get me wrong. We get along great. We have a similar sense of humor and similar nerdy interests and similar political views. Our sexual compatibility is ridiculous. I just don't feel this young adoration that she seems to feel for me. \n\nI really don't know what to do; I'm a total relationship noob. I'm worried that the distance is too inconvenient. I'm worried that I'm going to break her little heart. I indirectly tossed out the idea of an open relationship to her, but she did not go for it at all. We get along great, but part of me thinks I should break it off. I've tentatively agreed to visit her in a couple of weeks. Help?",

I've had girlfriends in the past and some casual shit, but have never truly cared for any of those girls and she's the only one good enough to get me emotionally invested and now I feel like a big fucking pussy about it and act like one too.\n\nWe're both military she adored me, I adored her back but knew orders would eventually seperate us.

So we're eventually seperated (fuck you military stop giving me good people and taking them away) and I get all nervous and paranoid because of course the only girl I ever fucking care about is now not with me and I eventually get all annoying about her friends because they're all guys because she's military. It was my first long distance thing because before that I was like \"lol why would I wait for some dumb girl\" and then she comes into my life and I'm like oh I understand why people fall in love now and do stupid things because of it.\n\nSo she is becoming more distant and some more awful shit happens in her life when she's goes home. She's tough but has her own way of handling things which is to not communicate with anyone and this makes me frustrated because I can't stand not talking to her.\n\nShe eventually says that it won't work over the phone and I'm like wtf you dumb perfect girl you wanted this to happen. So I've been trying not to talk to her and delete her from social media but I still end up texting her and saying stupid shit especially when I'm drunk.

The good news is that both of us can see a future with one another in the long term, and that we have great communication.\n\nThe not-so-good news is that we are both ambivalent about children. It would be one thing if one of us wanted kids and the other didn't, but right now, both of us can't seem to come to a decision about kids. We have talked about it at length, and cannot come to some kind of final stance as to whether we want kids or not. \n\nIn some ways, we can picture ourselves as a family unit of two parents and one or two kids. That image doesn't make us retch or turn our head around. But then detracting issues pop up. One case is my medical condition. I have a brain tumor that is benign for now, but could act up statistically speaking, and that is a concern for both of us. \n\nCan this change or solidify if we finally get stable jobs?

        "45": "POST: Hey everyone. My roommate and I are coming to the end of 2 years of living together. Long story short, I will not continue to live with him beyond 2 years.\n\nWe used to work together and I thought he had his act together. Little did I know it was all a front. He hardly leaves the apartment besides to go to work, never buys household goods, barely cleans up after himself, and definitely doesn't do his fair share of things around the apt.\n\nHe's generally a nice guy but he's completely oblivious and can be really inconsiderate. For example we used to smoke (weed) together from time to time. I am for the most part cool with it. Then it started turning into 12 hour smoke sessions where he would sit in his room all day smoking. I eventually asked him to stop smoking inside, but slowly he started to again. Finally one night, I had had enough and I called him out and he's taken to smoking outside.\n\nSo here's what happened. At the beginning of the month he told me a friend of his needed a place to stay for a few days. I obliged under the agreement that she wouldn't be in the apt all day (I'm working from home and interviewing, speaking on the phone with privileged information, financials, etc.)\n\nHere we are almost two weeks later. She's been here almost every day. The one day she wasn't here, he had his FWB staying the night.\n\nI'm incredibly annoyed at this point. I texted him yesterday (as I knew I wouldn't be home when he was.) Yet he never replied. I texted him again this AM and still crickets.\n\nMy friends say I'm more upset than I should be, but I think my anger is justified. It makes more work for me (constantly emptying the dishwasher, trash I only take out, lack of any kind of alone time in MY own apartment.) I'm not sure what to do at this point. I know I have to confront him but I feel like such a nag with these situations he puts me in. Any type of advice for confronting this would be really appreciated.",

One is an old fling who, to be honest, is mostly just somebody I have a more physical relationship with. Pretty simple, no complications.\n\nThe second is a guy I've been seeing for about two months now. We have lots of fun together, great convo, but nothing has been defined yet. While I can't prove it without flat-out asking, I'm pretty positive he's seeing other people, too. I'm also pretty sure what he and I have is a really casual dynamic. It's not no strings attached, but it's not a serious relationship, either.\n\nThe third is a guy I've started seeing more recently. I really like him! He's smart, handsome, engaging\u2014if I'm going to be honest, he might be one I'd choose out of the three, but I'm not sure. It could just be the rush of getting to know someone new.

I'm not sure I'm cognizant of how to transfer that to my life, though. At what point do I make the decision to become exclusive with someone? I'm not sure how to navigate these waters, and I should admit I'm pretty bad at deciphering my own emotions. And do I disclose that I'm seeing other people?

My friends who I hang out with on a regular basis, and who I've known throughout college, are all pretty large in body size. Some of them are tipping on the edge of being overweight and some are obese. I'm the thinnest and most fit one in the group. I'm constantly out doing stuff, whether it be running and being active or making plans to go do active stuff, i.e. being outside. They never seem excited to do these sorts of things and would rather spend their nights inside, watching Netflix, drinking liquor/beer, or playing video games. It's really frustrating sometimes. They're a great group of people that I genuinely enjoy spending time with because they're good natured, funny, and we all support eachother when someone is going through a rough time. I just hate that they never want to be active and go to events/places like I do. It's always a fight for \"time\" and \"money\" and \"getting off work\", etc, etc - the list goes on. But I know that's it mostly bullshit because they are happy to plan an event where we get together at someone's house just to drink and have fun.\n\nI don't know what to do. I understand that I can meet more people who are into a similar lifestyle as mine (thank god my girlfriend is an active person), but I've known these guys for so long, I just wish I could motivate them into losing weight and being active - they have no idea what kind of life they're missing.",
        "49": "POST: My 3 year old GSD x Husky rescue stayed with some relatives for a few days while my boyfriend and I moved house, and the relatives found an old choke chain to walk him with, instead of his Mekuti harness. We have had real problems with him pulling on the lead, and the Mekuti harness has worked wonders, but didn't eliminate the problem. He hasn't pulled when on the choke chain at all, even when it was first put on apparently, so we think that is what he was trained on (and damage from that process is probably why his barks and whines sound a bit odd). We now think the people who had him before us were violent towards him (if you mime kicking he runs across the room terrified), so, my question is: he is best behaved on walks when wearing a choke chain, and it isn't hurting him at all, but will the harm chokers and the people using them caused him in the past affect him in any way now? I 100% DO NOT want to use a choke chain on him and I don't think anyone should ever, ever train a dog that way, but this chain is the only lead we've used that has completely solved the problem with him pulling, and he hasn't seemed stressed out by it. If he ever started pulling on the lead so that the choker was tight, I would stop using it straight away. The last thing I want is my dog being hurt. If I'd known these relatives were going to put one on him, I wouldn't have let them look after him. Still, it works and doesn't hurt him, my only worry is it'll do psychological damage somehow.",

I am his first serious relationship and only sexual partner\n\nQuick and simple: I have never made a big deal out of sex, and, in general, would not mind an open relationship.  However, my SO would never ever allow me to be with another man, so because of that, in this case, I don't feel comfortable being in an open realtionship with him.  Because he knows my views on sex (that I don't care all that much about monogomy) he considers this to be me playing tit for tat with him, and considers it unreasonable.   He is young and has only been with me, I understand him wanting to explore sexually.  But again, I would not feel comfortable in a one sided open relationship.  He said its not about me, this is something he wants, why am I making it about myself, tit for tat, etc.  \n\nSimilar example: he got upset when I mentioned i wanted to go to a bar some years ago and said he's not comfortable with it. I respected that.  About a year later, he asked to go to a strip club with his friends. Here's the thing, do I care about a boyfriend I am with going to a strip club?  In general, No.  I get that it's all fun.  But again, I would expect that same freedom to be granted to me.  Because he would not even allow me to go to a bar even though I don't drink and would just go with friends to hang out, yeah, I told him no don't go, I don't feel comfortable. Again, another fight about how I'm fucking him around playing games with him.  I'm really not trying to, it's just with this particular situation I would have felt entirely disrespected.  He said it's my fault for feeling disrespected.",

We told each other that we still miss each other and so on, but I was having difficult time, so I had to think a lot. \n\nA month passes by and I see on her facebook wall a photo with another dude [23] and caption said \"We're happy\" and I immediately got angry and wrote her. She told me he was just a friend, I believed her. The next evening we met up at her place, talked casually and then sex happened. While we were having sex, she told me that she loves me, I told her that I love her too. Sweet, maybe this will work out.\n\nAfter that for a few days we chatted, then met up again, had sex, usual couple things.. Then she started ignoring me. Then suddenly that \"friend\" became a boyfriend. So then our relationship was like a roller-coaster. One day she loves me, other she doesn't. We would hang out together, kiss and stuff, and then nothing again.\n\nWell, last week I get a message, that she is getting married with that \"friend\" (few days before that, she told me that she still likes me, and kissed a bunch). I couldn't believe it. I was trying to talk her out of that for the past week, but nothing came of it. She told me that she understands that she rushed it, that it can be a mistake and such, even told me that she doesn't love me. Yesterday she met up with a mutual friend, and she told that friend that she is happy, that she doesn't want to see me, and will call cops if I come near her. Now that I confronted her about how she cheated with me on her future husband she got angry.\n\nSo their wedding date is on August 13th, only over 3 months will be passed after our breakup.

Before he moved in there, he used to go to the gym regularly, eat well, and go to church. Since he's moved in with them, he's gained about 30 lbs. To be fair, I've gained weight as well since we started dating, but it's mostly because I started at a University with a meal plan, and later on I could only afford cheap, less-healthy food. I've been trying to work with him constantly for both of us to go to the gym more, eat better, and go to church together.  He ends up going out to eat way more than he should (his friends all have good paying jobs and don't really care about their health, while he's still looking for a job in his field of study), and is just generally negatively affected by the environment. I like the person he is when we're alone a lot better than him around his guy friends. It seems like he just makes a lot of poor choices around this group. I don't know how to go about telling him this...I know guys can be sensitive when it comes to their friends, though he already knows I don't like his friends. They give me a hard time a lot and tend to make me feel like crap- they've actually reduced me to tears a few times. On that note- they're about 70/30 as far as being jerks goes. Maybe 1/3 of the time they're actually decent to me, but I mostly end up feeling belittled and uncomfortable- it's a lot like High School. I've talked to him about this multiple times, and he says that A) I need to stand up for myself, and B) I need to let him know when I get upset, because he genuinely doesn't know what's making me upset, or what they say that sets me off. So, suggestions for how to bring this up with him?",

I knew I had little chance with this woman (she's very attractive), but it was worth a shot asking her out for a few dates.\n\nNevertheless, I gathered all the courage in the world, and told her how I felt and if she would give me a chance to go out with her.

It's the acting gay - acting *really* gay. Everyone knows what I'm talking about. It just seems disingenuous when someone's being as flamboyant as possible. I can understand it when someone's just coming out and feels the need to express their sexual identity, or in a pride parade - go wild, I say. \n\nBut when I see adult men acting like total queens, I just want to tell them to grow the hell up.

I've had her for a year and during this time, there is always one spot at a time she keeps licking, 4 in total so far, with one being here for months now on her front leg, fur is gone and it was infected before. She keeps licking until it bleeds, and when I find out I'll put ointment on it. I've been to the vet before because she seems to have developed an allergy to something randomly (started getting scaly skin and dandruff), but it hasn't been determined what it is yet (not food) and the licking issue, while brought up, wasn't really directly addressed.

I find myself thinking things like \"if I was single I'd go do this\" or \"if I became single again I'd go here or try this\" & I'm realising that if I ever want to do those things, it likely won't be while I'm with him.\n\nBut, here's the hard part - I have no idea if he feels the same way - he knows something is wrong because I've completely shut down over the weekend, my mind is so jumbled and I'm so confused that I didn't eat anything yesterday so I'm obviously not feeling well. Hes been too sweet to me, massaging my back before I fell asleep last night, etc, so I feel like this might completely blindside him.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there's lots about him I love, he's kind (most of the time), he can always make me laugh or smile with his goofy sense of humor, but I really don't know if I csn do this anymore. I feel held back, trapped! I know I could go do all those things with other people while still with him but I fear the rarely seeing eachother due to our schedules would just end in a breakup anyways..\n\nSo what I need is advice - How do I do it? We live together so this will be incredibly hard... I'm so scared to break his heart, I'm scared he'll get angry.

In August of 2008, I had just quit grad school, hated my life, and was really exceptionally depressed.  I was renting a tiny bedroom in a house in the middle of nowhere, and I had no job.  [I weighed 245 pounds]  I got a job waiting tables, and my weight slowly began to drop.  Starting in November of 2009, I liked what had been happening and decided to actively try losing weight.  By September 2010, [I was down to about 190] had a great job, great friends, and was really, really stoked.\n\nHere's where things get tricky.  Around this time, I started dating a super-excellent guy.  Our social circles have meshed effortlessly, and we spend a lot of time together.  He's a really picky eater, though, and doesn't like most of the stuff that I do (which is, coincidentally, the food that's helped me lose weight), so we end up eating out a lot.  Not only has my wallet taken a solid hit, I've gained about 15 pounds since we started dating.  Not enough to really *see*, but I'm definitely more sluggish, and it bothers me a lot.  On top of all this, I've become much more busy, now that I have a \"real\" job and I have an active group of friends.\n\nWhat do I do, folks?  I really don't know where to go from here.  I honestly don't know what a good goal weight for me is, and while I can work more activity into my life pretty easily, I don't know how to deal with the \"I'm always out, what on earth do I eat?\" problem.\n\nI'm sorry if this was weirdly-phrased and rambly -- I'll clarify if y'all have questions, but I really would love some help on how to get myself together again.",

My accounting department has consistently called me about mis-allocated funds wondering where they are supposed to go, especially at year end. Every month prior to our new computer system I was consistently owed money due to statements needing to be finalized, and it was corrected on the following check.

We have a steady relationship and we're very happy.\n\nEarly in the relationship, I went to my friends cousin's house to hang out. My bf didn't come. We were all hanging out and drinking and another of my friend's cousins who I had kissed a few years back showed up. \n\nI got really drunk. The cousin was trying really hard to sleep with me, I kept saying no and he knew I had a boyfriend. \n\nEventually I blacked out. I found out in the morning that the guy kept trying to get me to sleep in his bed with him which I refused (thank god). However someone told me that i was leaning against him on the couch and she wasnt sure but he may have been kissing my neck.\n\nI felt absolutely disgusted after I found this out. I had a huge talk with my friend and she thought it was best for me not to mention it to my boyfriend because it was a new relationship and I had been adamant that I didn't want to hook up with him. I didn't say anything to him.\n\nI hadn't really thought about it much until recently. About six months ago I came to terms with the fact that I have an alcohol abuse problem. I've been sober now for three months. I've been seeing things much more clearly now and this event is really starting to bother me. \n\nI know nothing like this will ever happen again, because I am confronting my problem, and I'll never let myself be in that state again.

It is confirmed that she is intending to have kids in approximately 5 years.\n\nShe's had quite a history including a divorce from her end. From the looks of it she's basically treating me already like the expected husband that her first turned out not to be. This is concerning me somewhat.

I don't want to waste her precious years on someone not willing to commit, but she's also pretty swamped at the moment with family and financial issues and leaning heavily on me for emotional support.

We tried again after about 2 more hours, and the same thing happened again.  This time we isolated the newer cat in the bedroom and gave our first cat run of the apartment.

We tried to be friends afterward and did our best, but communication quickly tapered off. I assumed from the lack of emotions I was feeling toward her and the lack of communication that I was getting over her.\n\nThen this week she visited my city.\n\nShe invited a bunch of our old friends (and myself) out for dinner, so I figured, sure, why not, let's cement her status as a friend. This will be casual enough.\n\nAnd it was. We had a great time, laughed like crazy, and found ourselves finishing each other's sentences like we did when we first fell for each other. It was a really fun night, closed with a loving goodbye hug.\n\nI say loving because the second I go, reality smacked me in the face. I was still in love with her, just as much as when I broke up with her. I spent the night brooding over it, and decided that the best course of action was to be blunt about it. I texted her the next day telling her in fairly simple terms what the night had done for me - it made me realize I was still head over heels for her.\n\nAnd she never responded.\n\nI'm entirely okay with that. Hell, I'm happy about that. It put things into perspective. Four months of acting like I was okay with being friends with a girl I never even had the chance to see that way wore on me. I realized how much self-respect I was abandoning just by keeping up this charade and allowing her to be how I validated myself.\n\nAnd, honestly? Fuck that. I'm awesome, and I don't need her to tell me that to know it. I feel like I've lifted a weight from my shoulders, and for the first time in four months I'm genuinely happy to be single.

Other co-workers have noticed it and joke with us about it...they'll say something like \"give that to your boss\" and he'll say \"pft\". It's getting annoying.

It's one of those mornings where I simply could not wait 30 seconds for him to finish, I had to piss *now*.

I scanned each car individually and they all appeared totally empty.  Perfect, open the flood gates.\n\nBut as fate would have it, on the one god damn morning I decide to piss out the deck door, halfway through my business some lone motherfucker just swings his car door open and hops out like it's nothing out of the ordinary to sit in his car at 6:15am doing literally nothing.  I had my pants pulled down just enough to reveal just my dick; I don't even care if he saw it.  I cared more about cutting off the flow and not dribbling all over the inside rug for fuck's sakes.\n\nWhat the fuck though, does anyone else experience this?

The evidence was falsified to begin with, Jenny McCarthy is an idiot, etc, etc. Vaccines have also, on the whole, been an enormous boon to the health of humanity, saving more lives than anything else ever (probably). The evidence here is overwhelming.\n\nAnd yet, the \"vaccines are good and everyone should them\" mentality is too simplistic. The issue has many angles, and in a community that often engages in exploring and exposing the more hidden side of things I am consistently surprised by the vociferous down-voting and down-shouting of any opinion that questions the aggressive vaccine schedule recommended by the CDC.\n\nThe fact is, every medication--vaccines included--carries a real set of risks. Medications are, or should be, given as the least-bad alternative: the risks associated with giving the medicine are outweighed by the rewards of giving the medicine. Each vaccine has its own risk/reward profile, and for that reason each warrants individual consideration. The CDC has given this consideration to the vaccines that are on (and not on) the recommended schedule, but that doesn't mean all medical professionals are in agreement regarding the schedule or even the need for all vaccines, nor does it mean that all individuals should refrain from individually investigating each vaccine should they so desire.\n\nThere are vested interests in the vaccination schedule, and the CDC is heavily lobbied by the pharmaceutical industry that produces the vaccines we all pay for through our private insurance carriers. This does not necessarily mean that we are having vaccines pushed on us that we don't really need, potentially at risk to our health (however minimal that risk may be), but the incentive is definitely there. Big companies make big money with a more aggressive vaccination schedule. This is as indisputable as is the evidence that vaccines do not cause autism.\n\nSo why not some actual skeptical discussion instead of the blind faith attached to the recommended vaccine schedule? Why not a little more critical thinking and consideration?",

She spends a lot of nights over at my place, and I noticed that whenever I went to take a shower before bed, after I came back she would be on my laptop and quickly close down some open tabs. I didn't think much of it the first few times, figuring maybe she was looking at something embarrassing, but then I noticed it turned into an every night thing whenever we spent a few days together.\n\nI checked my browser history, and she is looking at her ex's facebook. Specifically, her ex, and her ex's new girlfriend. I know that she had a rough breakup very shortly before we started dating. She was married to him for 6 years and said that he was very controlling and not a good match for her, and when she wanted to leave he put her through a huge guilt trip and made it difficult. I've noticed that about once a week she will exchange a few texts with him and be off in the bathroom crying about it. \n\nThat said, she has told me how happy she is with me and doesn't know why she is still sad about a bad relationship ending. I figured some of it was just curiousity over what her ex was doing and who he was with, but coupled with the crying about it makes me wonder if she is just not over him.\n\nI don't know what to do about the situation because when she does the weekly crying routine, she is emotionally wrecked for the whole night and it sucks. I've tried to be understanding and give her space, but it's not getting better. The Facebook thing also affects her. During the day/evening she will be flirty and talking about all the stuff we're going to do in bed, and then after I get out of the shower and she's been on his Facebook, it's like she's emotionally unavailable the rest of the night.\n\nI really love her though so I want to try and make it work, it's just I'm not sure of the right way to handle this situation.",

Just to understand what issues I am dealing with I should explain that he had no job, didn't graduate from high school, didn't pay or offer me anything but I was young and in love so it didn't matter.  \n\nAnyway, since then I've become a bit of a lone wolf.  I'm a fiercely independent woman, almost to a fault.  I kind of feel like it may be that I'm trying to prove something but I'm not sure what that is.\n\nI met a guy about 5 months ago through some mutual friends.  We have a lot of common interests like guns, camping and generally having a good time.  We started dating seriously about a month ago and he refers to me as his girlfriend.  \n\nWithin the past two days we've realized we are different.  He's conservative with traditional values and I'm more liberal and unconventional.  It's almost a good thing because he's grounding me a little more and I'm opening up his mind to different ways of thinking.  However, I've realized that he's a bit self absorbed.  Not in a narcissistic way but he only seems to be able to relate things through himself.  I put a lot of effort into being interested in his projects but he doesn't make an effort to being interested in my projects.  I can tell that issues from my last relationship are urging me to abandon ship immediately for fear of being hurt again and I wonder if I'm almost TRYING to find reasons to leave.  \n\nBasically, we have two issues.  I had basically conviced myself that I wanted to be alone but I found a guy I genuinely care about.  He makes me happy and the thought of being with him doesn't make me nauseous.  Secondly, are we incompatible or am I trying to make us incompatible?  If I'm already sensing he's a little self absorbed should I continue this relationship?",

So we started texting everyday and hung out once and we're going on a date Saturday. Sounds straightforward right?\n\nWell tonight as I was texting her I complimented her and she told me that she wasn't used to people being nice to her and told me that we're just friends.

I said only if she wanted to, and I got a yeah with a smiley. \n\nThen I asked if it'll bother her that I like her when we're hanging out and she said, \" No because we'll be getting to know each other.\" She even confirmed it as a date that we're going out Saturday.\n\nSo does she want to like me, already does or won't at all?

Any time something is taking awhile, or we need to be patient for something we tend to say \"give it a second, it's going to space\" in reference to this Louis CK bit \n\nMy opinion is people need to chill a little when they hit these frustrating points. Bodies are natural systems, respect yours, it can only change so much so fast. The changes some people here are making are so all encompassing that encountering these problems means you deserve a pat on the back because they represent just how far you've come.

Let alone exercise without feeling like death?\".

We met at work and saw each other pretty much everyday.

Some reason that it's worth doing it.\n\nI have tried talking to him about it. He mentioned that he didn't want to be one of those people who start taking the next step in their relationship because they reach a certain age. He also said he can't tell me he knows he wants to be with me because he doesn't know, and that he doesn't know what will happen in the future. \n\nI just don't know if this is a waste of my time and energy.

However, I know how important that is, especially in full time roles.\n\nI would really appreciate some help with this matter. If you need further information, please ask.",

I am married and am busy with a toddler, so perhaps I haven't really been affected by his unfriendliness. Prior to this morning I would have told you that he is aloof, distant, and wants his own life. Nothing out of the ordinary. I'm a married woman with a homelife and he's a single guy living the bachelor life, nothing more than that. I knew he was kinda unfriendly but didn't read much into it, as our work paths don't cross much and he leaves me alone.\n\nThis morning I was browsing forums related to our area of work and recognized a post from him: no mistake; we are in the same narrow field. Without a doubt it is him. I went through his comment history.\nPredating his meeting me, he has a history of seeking out American women in our field on the internet and being abusive to them. Most of the self-identified American women on the 'net he is responding to are seeking advice or help; he is responding to them with hatred and vitriol and derision, I don't think I can type the words he is using and not get caught by the filter, but, he is using all of the typical anti-American slurs and all of the typical anti-female slurs. Dude is really. REALLY full of anger. Like: holy crap: he hates American women with the force of a million suns. He appears to spend every Sunday looking for American women on various internet forums relative to our field and being toxic to them. And his history of doing this under this internet nic goes back several years.\n\nAnyway, I'm not going to do anything at work but ignore him and continue to be polite to him, but: oh my god.",

We've broken up several times (I initiated all of the break-ups) and every time we stay apart for a while, but then both admit we miss each other and it's like I fall in love with her all over again. She's incredibly loving and supportive; We never fight and the reason for the breakups basically come from me growing bored of the relationship and feeling that our interests don't align.\n\nI recently moved overseas for work and broke up with her for the reasons above and because of the distance. But after two months of silence, we've been talking regularly and last night we admitted we still have feelings for each other and want to be together but don't know what to do. She told me she'd been with other people in the months we've been broken up, which really hurt me (I know it shouldn't, but it does).\n\nI'm fairly certain I don't want to be with her in the longterm, but I still really love her and the support she gives me. I always wonder whether or not I'll find other people who I'll fall in love with in the same way. I'm really torn here. I am very afraid of commitment (any kind; not just relationships) and I don't want to live just for her.

We talk about marriage and children a lot. Now we have picked up our lives and moved together to an entirely new city so that we both could have better jobs, but I think I need a fresh start and probably a break from men who do not know what it means to be exclusive.

        "181": "POST: I had a book when I was a kid in the early or mid 80s ... about a cat that has a bad habit of eating shoelaces.  It tells a moral story about gluttony/overindulgence and the cat gets bigger and bigger.  I think it also ate typewriters, or maybe just the keys.  The cat's parents are involved at some point.  The cat is reproved -- maybe by a doctor? -- who convinces the cat to eat such treats in moderation.  There might have also been turnips?? but I might be confusing the turnip part with a different book.  The book ends with the cat losing weight, and he only *occasionally* indulges in a typewriter key.   I remember the drawings -- a cat with shoelaces hanging all out of its mouth, and I think there were a variety of typewriters and different-looking keys.  To my recollection the drawings were black and white, pen-style.  Obviously this book left an impression on me.  I was hoping to give it to my nephew as a present, but I can't find it anywhere.  You would think the terms \"cat\", \"typewriter\", \"shoelaces\" aren't usually combined and would easily point to something.

        "201": "POST: All right, here's the deal. When the semester started, I met this girl in my Chem lab and we started talking. Infrequently for a while, but around a month ago started to pick up to the point that it was every day for the past few weeks. Anyway, I was very much into this girl. She's very pretty, and shares so many interests with me, it was a little surreal. \n\nTwo weeks ago we went on a date, which went really well, we ended up kissing at the end and I was a happy man. Ideally we would have had a second date this weekend or last, but it was easter and she went home, and this weekend is out for other reasons. So here's the problem. Starting earlier this week, our contact started to taper off, effectively not talking whatsoever this week. Obviously I was a little concerned, given how much we'd been talking before, so I said I'd like to talk to her, and she said she wanted to talk to me as well. \n\nSo we talk on the phone a bit, and here's the issue. She tells me that she wasn't sure if we were a couple or not (something we hadn't discussed, and I wasn't clear on either), and that she didn't feel ready to be in a couple. She said that she was still emotional over her last breakup, and she didn't feel emotionally ready to be in a relationship with me yet. This is followed by saying that she does really like me and wants to keep hanging out and talking and all that jazz. I of course understand that you can't control feeling not ready, and told her that, and saying that while disappointed, I wouldn't guilt trip her or pressure her into anything. \n\nAnyway, the vibe that I got was that a relationship wasn't off the table, just not right now. I feel that any relationship we would have would be a healthy, lengthy, and fulfilling one. So I suppose my wondering here is what I should do to make it clear that I am open to a relationship and fostering that relationship potential, while maintaining the friendship and giving her the time she needs.",

Background: I lost my contract job as a Sr. Systems Admin in December due to the dissolution of my department and I've been looking for work since.  The problem has been that my last job before this one was also contract and also one in which I was let go before the end of the contract term.  That unemployment stretch lasted about three months.  During that time, I applied to about 15-20 jobs per week and had an interview roughly every week and a half.  \n\nThis time around, with more experience and the same level of effort, I have had a total of 3 interviews, but these were not direct hires so I'm faced with the same risks as I have been at the last two positions. I've been targeting System admin/SQL developer/Business Analyst and Jr DBA-type positions both locally and out-of-state. Honestly, I'm not sure if it's my resume or the positions I'm applying to (or the fact that I don't have a CS degree), but I was really hoping for some feedback/advice on what I can do to get some interest.\n\nPlease see the redacted resume below.",

But lately I've been feeling so disappointed.\n\nI'd say the main issue is I've asked him time and time again to do things with me.  And not boring things that only I would like, but stuff like going to a baseball game. He agrees or I guess brushes me off and we never do anything.  All I want is to get out and off the couch on occasion, but he seems content with always doing that.  I couldn't tell you how many times I've talked to him about doing things together.\n\nI guess what really has me pissed at the moment is that he spent all day yesterday helping his new female roommate move in.  I'm not threatened by her and I know nothing would ever happen. What I am mad about though is he hasn't done anything like that for me in a long time.  I moved a couple months ago and he didn't lift a finger or offer to help.  This situation just leads me to thing about other things like how he'll go on trips with his friends but not me even though I always talk about wanting to go certain places and suggest we plan it out.  He'll go out with his friends, but never with me.  \n\nIt just sucks to not feel like a priority after 2 years.  I want to talk to him one last time about it and see if there's any hope at me feeling better.  Any advice on how to get through to him and not cause a major fight?",

On this particular day, I took those hits before getting dressed then realized I was going to miss the bus so quickly got dressed and left. While on the bus I noticed I kept getting weird glances and looks from the other strangers on the bus. I just wrote it off as I'm probably acting weird without noticing or am just being paranoid.

My Roommate is a friend(yes, I know...\"she won't be your friend after living together\") However, her anxiety and personal issues have resulted in some issues....\n\n    Having my boyfriend over, for example. We are private people and generally stay in my room reading books together. However, my roommate screamed that he is not allowed over at all, because it would make her uncomfortable. Now, I am paying my fair share of rent, we've split it evenly, even though she gets the bigger room. I feel that I should be allowed to have him sleep over on occasion so long as he isn't disruptive, noisy, peeing on the toilet seat, or putting the TP under instead of over. We have currently negotiated 4 days a month. She also does not want my friends over, ever.\n\n    I originally had plans to move in on Thursday/Friday, however due to last minute plans, I had to switch to Friday/Sunday. This resulted in us being there together Sunday. I was met with stomping everywhere she went and silence to any questions I asked....She is now saying that there will never, ever, be plan changes ever again. The first plan is the only plan. I have tried reasoning with her, telling her that she could have told me no to moving in Sunday, instead of throwing a temper tantrum, but she is set. When I tried reasoning with her, she told me that clearly I cannot think like an adult, therefore she is taking away my privileges to change plans. Lunch plans, dinner plans, general hanging out plans....etc. Meanwhile, she has bailed on me nearly every single time we make plans together, often only an hour or two before.\n\n    What have I gotten myself in to???

        "229": "POST: My GF recently became my fiancee.  I am sure she's been planning this day for a while in her head, but the only two details I've heard so far is that it is a \"$60k wedding\" and \"the groom/his family\" pays for it.  For reference, she is not from the U.S. originally (although she became a citizen in her teens), so her culture is weighing in here.  Her culture (middle eastern) is big on over-the-top events and the professional success to back it up.\n\nWe can technically afford this wedding, as between us we make about $300k/year, but I come from a lower middle-class background and spending $60k on a single event just seems preposterous.  It might even cause negative feelings with my family because no one has had a wedding that cost even half that much.\n\nThe problem is that I don't want to just say \"no\" because then I would look cheap.  I believe that she should get the day she wants, but I also think she could have just as great of a wedding on less (maybe $20-30k), so my challenge is to convince her that she could be happy, especially if it means we can keep it from impacting other milestones.  For example, she has already started talking about buying a house in the next 1-2 years.  Well, the average house exceeds $1 million in our area, so an expensive wedding is going to push that timeline back by a year or so if we are to contribute equally to the downpayment. (I'm 100% footing the bill for the wedding, remember).  We also both agree on trying to become financially independent of work as soon as possible, and are in general frugal people.  For example, we live in an old, cheap apartment, and she recently bought a used car.\n\nWhat can I do here?  Advice from people with non-American partners is particularly appreciated",

Today I realized that even though I gladly know nothing of her sex life(existent or not) she isn't a 9 year old girl who doesn't know what sex is. I then started browsing Reddit and saw a post about how a dad had discovered his daughter pretty much riding her boyfriend. I thought about how not only our dad but a ton of dads are probably devastated that their \"little girl\" is having sex. At this point I was for some reason really angry and didn't know why. It then dawned on me that I was thinking about my future and if I were to catch my daughter in the act of sex I would probably punch a hole in the wall as to not make a scene...(Obviously kidding but would be really upset non the-less) \n\nNow I'm feeling guilty because if I had a son and I caught him having sex I'd be fine with it, maybe even a little proud. I'm feeling guilty because this is a huge double standard and at my current age, heck even when I was in high school I knew of plenty of girls who were sexually active and didn't see it as a big deal. I know I'm being completely irrational about this seeing as how I don't even have any kids, but I was wondering if anyone had any input on why I was getting so worked up over something that could be 25 years down the line? \n\nI think I'd be fine if I was kind of oblivious to it.. i.e. NOT walking in on my daughter doing cowgirl in my own home.. I'm not a violent person nor would I do anything to this theoretical kid having sexy times with my theoretical daughter, but if I were to see it happen I would just flip..

I need to note here that I have never said one way or the other that it is wrong, she just felt like it would upset me. We have had an open conversation about the situation, and out of my trying to respect her and wanting her to be herself I told her that where I was a little uncomfortable with it, if that's what she wanted then I will do my best to be okay with it. \n\nReality is, I am not really okay with the situation. She has offered to include me and the other girl in certain sexual acts which at first sounded like a great thing, but the more I think about it, the more I hate the idea. I have basically become bummed out, feeling that I am no longer enough to satisfy her, and I do not want to have an open relationship or whatever this is considered. The hard part is at the same time I don't want to deny her who she is, or be a dickhead and put some kind of boundary on her. Guess I'm just not sure what to do. Anyways thanks for reading. I know this is a pretty common thing.\n\nThe other biggest and hardest thing about all of this, is my wife has a girl she is interested in already. She was honest about meeting her and everything, and is already arranging to meet up with the other girl. I've read some of the text messages and they are more flirtatious, more loving, and more exciting than anything I ever get from my wife. This is where my heart broke. Now I feel stupid.",

We went back to a friends house where I ended up falling asleep. The problem: I went to bed alone (he has a spare bedroom which he let me use because I lived half an hour away from him) but in the middle of the night I woke up being in between two of my male friends. We were fully clothed so I just assumed they would rather share a bed than just sleep on the floor, which didn't bother me, but the friend behind me was touching me in very private places (he didn't go under clothing though). I could hear him whispering things to himself and it was very obvious he was horny. I felt very uncomfortable about this and panicked so I pretended that I was still sleeping. This probably lasted for about an hour and even if I moved to try and get him off of me he would just pull me back.\nWhat I'm asking now is, what do I do? I didn't confront him about it this morning and I also haven't told my partner. I also feel like if i say anything i am going to cause a rift in the friend group which i really don't want to do.

I need to kiss her on Friday. I need to spark physical attraction to kiss her. I need to find courage to stop-doubting myself and just take her hand to spark physical attraction.

It gave me space to focus on schoolwork (I'm an engineering major and have 3 jobs on campus so I'm pretty busy) and an openness in my social life. A few weeks ago, I met this guy at a party, and we started flirting, nothing crazy, kissed, then I left. I thought it was a one-off thing, but we ended up going on a few dates before break and talk a lot now. \n\nHe's made it very clear that he wants a relationship. He doesn't play mind games (my ex did and I hated it) and is genuinely very sweet and we're surprisingly compatible. Honestly, I could see it working out really well. The issue is that I have found that I really enjoy the single life. After giving so much to a relationship and watching it flounder, I realized that I can be all that I need, and while this new guy is wonderful, I don't really want the commitment attached to a 'relationship'. I'm still really young and I want to enjoy college. At the same time, I don't want to miss out on a potentially really wonderful guy, nor do I want to hurt him at all. Help?",

We love each other, and say it every day. My family thinks he's great, and vice versa. He and my dad text each other about their 3d printing hobby. His mom sends me birthday gifts. Things are great, but we never talk about marriage except in very hypothetical terms. Like, I've asked him, \"Can you see yourself getting married to me?\" and he said \"Of course\".\n\nBut how do I ask about making it actually happen? Should I be blunt, like \"I want to get engaged in the next two years! Are you in?\" \n\nI'm so scared that real talk about marriage will freak him out. I've heard so much about how men are trying to avoid marriage. I don't want to lose the best relationship I've ever had because I was too impatient about marriage.\n\nPlease help!",

The dog is outside every day on my way to/from class and to/from the gym, and most of the rest of the time it seems. I live in North Philadelphia, not the nicest place, so I don't hang around the fence but every day as I pass, the dog is laying either on the pavement (Next to about 10 piles of it's droppings) or in this wooden shack looking dog house. Today the dog was sitting right along the fence. It's face was just droopy and miserable, it's eyes were blood red, and it seemed to have an abrasion/patch of fur missing on it's side/front leg. The last time I was this close to the dog, it barked at me. Today, it just stared blankly. I've been wondering what I can/should do all semester. Is there someone I can/should call? Should I mind my own business? In any other situation I'd have ZERO problem confronting someone about a case such as this (I'm a pretty decent sized guy) but as I said, I don't live in a great area and many of the locals here don't take kindly to students as it is. I've volunteered with PAWS (Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society) before so I imagine I might wanna start there.",

We both work in the food industry and hes planning on going back to school in 2 weeks. \n\nA little background on our jobs, its important to our disagreement. I am a salary manager in a very popular corporation and he is an hourly manager in another popular franchise. We both make enough money to make ends meet. With my salary I can pay for m half of the bills. He is an hourly manger but is working overtime, so he can make his ends meet as well. \n\nWell, he just put in his 2 weeks notice at his job today because his boss accused him of stealing from him and threaten him of \"breaking his fucking hand\" if he ever stole from him again. My boyfriend on the spot told him he is leaving in 2 weeks. \n\nNow I wouldnt mind so much if we were in a better economic state. I have about 2500 in debt right now and I am now worried about whats going to happen to our apartment. If we cant pay for it, its really going to affect us on our future like our credit score. Also our electricity bills and internet is under our names so that will affect us too. \n\nNow we just got over a heated discussion because he said I wasn't supporting him on his decision. He said, right away I told him he was wrong for leaving the job. That I didnt believe in him cause he kept saying \"things are going to be ok.  I can find another job, its not a big deal\".  \nWe also got in an argument about him thinking his team is going to follow him into whatever new job he has. I told him, in a restaurant youre by yourself, theres no such thing as a team. \n\nMy question is, am I making a mistake by freaking out about whats going to happen? Did I react too harshly to the news?"
